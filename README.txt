Source to various talks that uses pieces from each other --- enough to
run "meta-story". Run "talk.rkt" (or sometimes "talk.ss") to run a
talk.

The implementation of newer talks tends to be better than older talks,
so here's a rough reverse chronology:

 meta-story
 scope-sets
 meta-time
 racket-way
 tower
 scribble
 mredtalk3
 killsafetalk
 mredtalk2
 mmtalk
